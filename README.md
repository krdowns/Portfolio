## About This Project

This project used bootstrap as well as jquery to develop a simple portfolio site.


## Thought Process
For this site, I wanted to feature my works first. Secondly, I wanted an about me section, as well as a testamonials section to hear feedback from past clients. Finally, a contact form where potential clients can reach out for questions or comments regarding possible jobs.

## Unsolved Problems
My first carousel wouldn't properly adjust size with reduction in screen size.

The testamonials section kept displaying all three slides instead of rotating them on a timer.

My side nav bar is supposed to move to the top on a smaller screen with a hamburger menu, however the menu would not display, and the navbar would not move to the top.

## Biggest Wins/Challenges

My biggest win was figuring out the project's carousel as well as making most of the site's responsiveness.

My biggest challenge that I overcame was the formatting of the contact form. At first, the form would break on any resolution change, however as I moved things around, I was able to get it into place and responsive.
